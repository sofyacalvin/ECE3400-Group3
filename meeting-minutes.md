# Meeting Minutes

## September 14 

* Attendance: everyone is here
* Potentially adding gears to increase speed 
  * Distribute weight over bearings in future?
* Servos go different speeds backwards: need to modify speeds
* Speed of turning
  * Not to implement a full point turn, but partial
* Sensors
  * Do we want wall sensors running at all times or @ every intersection? 
    * Will decide later
* Return to lab 2
  * Need amplifier
  * Distinguish 660Hz tone from either side
  * "nicely merged?"
* Milestone
  * speed of servos/turning
* Emmett, sofya, dylan: Friday afternoon lab
* David, amanda: Saturday @ 2 lab

## September 15
* Attendence: everyone is here
* Milestone 1
  * Fixed common ground issue
    * Which fixed significant speed difference of servos
      * Switched to pin 11 for right servo, need to change figure 8 code accordingly
  * Can find running average of sensor data
    * Long run: memory issue
  * Time-based turn versus sensor-based turn
  * Test figure 8 code in lab later today
    * Additionally fix turns if time permits
  * Add rubber bands
  * Build amplifier circuit for treasures
  * Video of line following and figure 8
* Lab 2
  * Saturday lab
  * Band pass filter for microphone
    * Wasn't working with Arduino
  * FFT audio and treasure code on Github
* Reports
  * Emmett: Fourier part, audio
  * Amanda: oscilloscope testing, treasures
  * Sofya: hardware, schematics
  * Dylan: software (milestone)
  * David: wiring, testing, debugging, improvements
