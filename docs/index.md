We are the members of ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ for the Fall 2017 semester of ECE 3400 and this is our robot Brooklynn. We are very excited to be building our very own robot this semester which (hopefully) will have the ability to successfully navigate a large maze using various sensors and neural networks. We have an eventful semester ahead of us but we are looking forward to gaining real-world experience in both hardware and software as well as exploring our own ECE curiosities. Above all, our goal is to learn as much as we can throughout this entire process working together and have fun while doing so! Below, you will find all of the useful information that we used to accomplish this project including manuals, schematics, tutorials, and more!
