# Team Contract
ECE 3400, Fall 2017, Group 3
 
## Team Procedures
* This team will meet every Friday during open school hours from 11:15-12:05 in the ECE Lounge in Phillips Hall. 
  * Additionally, members will attend the lab section on Mondays from 1:25-4:25.
* Any other team meetings will have a time and location agreed upon collectively in the group chat.
  * This can be suggested by the Team Lead or any other member.
  * On a bi-weekly basis, a WhenIsGood (http://whenisgood.net/) will be sent out to determine a meeting time if necessary.
* Team decisions will be made by striving for consensus; however, in the case consensus is not met, majority vote of present members will be used.
* Preferred method of communication will be Slack. Channels and direct messages will be used according to delegated tasks.
  * If necessary, members can video into meetings.
* Meeting minutes will be taken by a member other than the Team Lead in the Slack #notes channel at every meeting.
* At every meeting, members will report the status of their work including their accomplishments, work in progress, and future goals for the upcoming week.

## Team Expectations

### Work Quality
* Ask for help, preferably early, if you know you will not be able to meet a deadline or generally need help with something.
* Expectations involve a fully functional robot and any additions, fun or functional, as time allows.
* Class deadlines should be met, or very nearly met, 24 hours in advance.
* Team-set deadlines should be met by the agreed-upon time with a less than a day of grace period if previously unknown circumstances arise.

### Team Participation
* Show up to meetings.
* Be honest about your limitations and other commitments.
* If the workload seems unfairly distributed, it can be brought up in a team meeting or in the Slack group.

### Personal Accountability
* Let other members know ahead of time if you will not be able to make a meeting.
* Respond to communications in a timely manner (within 24 hours).

### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
* If an individual misses more than two consecutive meetings without justification, then the member must bring snacks for the next meeting.
* If a member fails to meet a class deadline or consistently produces subpar work that must be re-done, the team will decide how to proceed however they reserve the right to notify the Professor/TAs of the skewed distribution of work and given circumstances.
* Failure to adhere to the Team Contract will be open to discussion at team meetings, and further consequences may be considered.

## Team Leadership
* The team leader’s main focus is to organize and manage deadlines, meetings, etc.
* Constructive criticism is not limited to team leaders. Team members should always be critiquing others’ work.
