## Team Expectations

### Work Quality
* Ask for help, preferably early, when you know you will not be able to meet a deadline or generally need help with something.
* Expectations involve a fully functional robot and any additions, fun or functional, as time allows.
* Class deadlines should be met, or very nearly met, 24 hours in advance.
* Team-set deadlines should be met by the agreed-upon time.

### Team Participation
* Show up to meetings.
* Be honest about your limitations and other commitments.
* If the workload seems unfairly distributed, it can be brought up in a team meeting or in the Slack group.

### Personal Accountability
* Let other members know ahead of time if you will not be able to make a meeting.
* Respond to communications in a timely manner (within 24 hours).

### Consequences for Failing to Follow Procedures and Fulfill Expectations
* If an individual misses more than two consecutive meetings without justification, then the member must bring snacks for the next meeting.
* In the case a member fails to meet a class deadline, the topic will be discussed as a team. 
* Failure to adhere to the Team Contract will be open to discussion at team meetings, and further consequences may be considered.

### Team Leadership
