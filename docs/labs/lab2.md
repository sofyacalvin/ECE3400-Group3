# Lab 2: Analog Circuitry and FFTs
Acoustic team: David Kim, Dylan Machado, Emmett Milliken

Optical team: Sofya Calvin, Amanda Trang


## Objective 
The goal of this lab was to get familiar with the microphone and the IR sensor that we would be adding to our robot. We did this by using the Open Music Labs Arduino FFT library to map the Fourier Transforms of the signals that the sensors were detecting. Additionally, we utilized op-amps to create filters and amplifiers for the audio and optical signals. In the future, these will be incorporated onto the robot to detect a 660Hz start signal as well as IR-emitting treasures throughout the map.

## Procedure
We initially split into two teams: Acoustic and Optical. The Acoustic team (David, Dylan, Emmett) focused on the microphone circuit, while the Optical team (Sofya, Amanda) worked with the IR sensor. Each team was to do the Fourier analysis corresponding to their circuit. As we did not finish during our lab hours, much of the lab was completed with varying members of the team during open lab.

### IR sensor circuit
The goal of the Optical team was to detect a 7kHz IR beacon through the Arduino. We first created a simple circuit (shown below) to detect the IR-emitting treasure.

//how to change size??

The operating principle of the phototransistor is that it allows more current to pass with the more light it receives; and, similarly, less current to pass with less light. We were able to test the functionality of this simple circuit by using the oscilloscope. The output voltage would lower when the phototransistor was covered (i.e. exposed to no light). 

We set the treasures by attaching the output to the oscilloscope and adjusting the amplitude and frequency. 

//not done yet i'm just saving it lol
