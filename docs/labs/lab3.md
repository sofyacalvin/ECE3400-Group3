# Lab 3: FPGA Video Controller and Sound Generation
Graphics team: Sofya Calvin, Amanda Trang, Dylan Machado

Audio team: Emmett Milliken, David Kim

## Objective 
This lab has two main goals: one, to take external inputs from the Arduino to the FPGA and display them on a screen through VGA; and two, to generate a three-tone sound to a speaker via the 8-bit DAC. The graphics portion is intended to be a stepping stone toward a final goal of mapping the maze on-screen during competition, while the audio portion will eventually signal the completion of the maze.

## Procedure

### Graphics
#### DAC on VGA connectors

+ calculating resistor values

#### Drawing one box



#### Updating array dependent on inputs

+ drawing the whole colorful grid

+ mention of voltage divider calculation

#### Reading external inputs to FPGA

+ arduino code

+ disaster of writing to pins

#### Mapping external inputs on screen


### Audio
#### Connecting the FPGA output to the the speaker
#### Outputting a square wave to the speaker
#### Outputting three tones via DAC
