![Emmett Milliken](IMG_0874.png) | **Emmett Milliken** I am a junior in ECE with the future goal of going in to research and development of entertainment lighting fixtures. I love colors and moving things you can program, and automated entertainment lighting is a great fusion of those. In addition to lighting, I am also interested in all other kinds of entertainment/production/stage tech, including audio and special effects equipment. When I am not doing school or tech related things, I enjoy hiking, kayaking, quilting, and finding any excuse to use label makers and power tools. | eam348@cornell.edu
