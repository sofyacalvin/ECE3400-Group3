# Milestone 2

## Objective
The primary goal of Milestone 2 is to be able to distinguish between three treasure frequencies--7kHz, 12kHz, and 17kHz--using our Lab 2 FFT with the IR phototransistor. Additionally, we implemented a short-range wall sensor in order to autonomously detect walls.

## Procedure

### Treasure Detection

### Autonomous Wall Detection
