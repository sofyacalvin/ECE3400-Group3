# Milestone 1

For Milestone one, our team was required to make our robot follow a black line as well as complete a figure 8. 

## Following a Line

For the first part of the milestone, we had to figure out how to make our robot follow a line. We determined that the best way to approach this was to use sensors to read and track the line as the robot follows it. This means we were faced with two challenges: the placement and usage of sensors to detect the line, and the act of remaining on the line and following it as the robot moves.

### Hardware

### Software

To make our robot follow a line, we coded a way for the robot to utilize the two center sensors in front. First, we obtained data from the sensors to determine the values of white and black. From there, we created an algorithm represented by this pseudocode:

[PIC]

With this, if one sensor went off of the line, the robot would turn and correct itself to have both sensors over it again.

The video above shows our robot in action. It correctly follows a line, and corrects itself as it moves. With the first part done, we were ready to move on to the next step.

## Figure 8

For the figure 8, we faced several more challenges. The robot needed to follow a line, but it also needed to turn at and cross specific junctions. To do this, we needed the robot to determine where these junctions were, and how to act at these junctions.
